/**
 * Read the CSP nonce from the `<meta name="csp-nonce">` tag in `index.html`.
 *
 * The nonce is injected at serve time by Caddy's `templates` directive
 * (substituting `{{placeholder "http.request.uuid"}}` with a per-request
 * UUID). At runtime, this reader parses the meta tag and returns the nonce
 * string, which is passed to Base UI's `CSPProvider` and Motion's
 * `MotionConfig` so every dynamically injected `<style>` element carries
 * the nonce.
 *
 * See `docs/security.md#csp-nonce-infrastructure` for the full flow.
 *
 * The value is read once on first call and cached for the lifetime of the
 * page -- both present and absent results are cached. Missing or invalid
 * values are logged so deployment misconfigurations are visible:
 *
 * - In production, the un-substituted Go template placeholder reaching
 *   the client indicates Caddy's `templates` directive is broken -- this
 *   is logged at ERROR level because the CSP will block every injected
 *   `<style>` tag.
 * - In the Vite dev server (`import.meta.env.DEV`), the placeholder is
 *   always present (Caddy never runs), so the same condition is logged at
 *   DEBUG level to avoid false-positive noise on every local page load.
 *
 * **Threat model note:** The nonce is readable by all same-origin JavaScript,
 * so it does not prevent an attacker who has already achieved XSS from
 * reusing it. Its purpose is to permit Base UI and Motion's
 * dynamically injected `<style>` tags under a CSP that forbids
 * `'unsafe-inline'` on `style-src-elem`. The nonce must be per-request and
 * unpredictable (Caddy's `{http.request.uuid}` placeholder, a 128-bit
 * UUID generated per request) to prevent replay across requests.
