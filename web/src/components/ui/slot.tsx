/**
 * Local polymorphism primitive used by {@link Button} for its `asChild` prop.
 *
 * Clones its only child and merges the passed props onto it using Base UI's
 * {@link mergeProps}, which handles className concatenation and event-handler
 * chaining with the same semantics as Base UI components. For primitives that
 * come directly from `@base-ui/react/*` (Dialog, AlertDialog, Popover, etc.),
 * prefer their native `render` prop instead of this helper -- `<Slot>` exists
 * only to keep the `<Button asChild>` ergonomic working for consumers that
 * would otherwise need to spread props manually.
 *
 * `Children.only` and `cloneElement` are intentional here -- they are the only
 * way to implement Slot semantics. The helper is tightly scoped to `<Button
 * asChild>`, so the `@eslint-react/no-children-only` and
 * `@eslint-react/no-clone-element` warnings are intentionally suppressed.
