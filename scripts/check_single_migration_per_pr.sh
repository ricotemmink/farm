# Enforce: at most one new Atlas migration file per PR.
#
# Rationale: during a feature PR we want a clean schema history -- if the
# developer iterates on the schema multiple times they should delete the
# in-progress migration and regenerate it (the "delete-and-regenerate"
# workflow), so that the final PR ships exactly one migration. Multiple
# migrations per PR make review harder and pollute the release history.
#
# Algorithm:
#   1. Resolve the PR base branch dynamically: BASE_BRANCH env var wins, then
#      GITHUB_BASE_REF (set by GitHub Actions on PR events), falling back to
#      origin/main for local ad-hoc runs. This lets hotfix / release-branch PRs
#      use their real base instead of always comparing against main.
#   2. Ensure the resolved base ref is fetched (or fail in CI / skip locally).
#   3. Count new `.sql` files added under both SQLite and Postgres revisions
#      directories on HEAD that do not exist on the resolved base branch.
#   4. Fail if any single backend has more than 1 new migration.
#
# The script runs on every commit (pre-commit stage) and every push (pre-push
# stage). On the `main` branch itself the check is skipped (main never adds
# its own migrations outside of a squashed PR).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 -- allow (0 or 1 new migrations)
#   1 -- error (fetch failed or other unrecoverable condition)
#   2 -- blocked (more than one new migration)
