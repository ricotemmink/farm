# anyone who already ran them. Regeneration of a migration that was
# added earlier on the same PR branch (delete + `atlas migrate diff`)
# is an allowed workflow -- the net diff against main is still a
# single new file, so this script permits it.

# Exit codes:
#   0 -- allow (no migration touched, or only PR-local migrations changed)

# origin/main so the check reflects the PR's net effect on main --
# not intermediate branch state. This lets agents delete + regenerate
# their own in-flight migrations without bypassing the check.
#
# Unusual checkouts (shallow clones, detached CI jobs that never
# fetch origin/main) cannot evaluate the check. By default we fail
# CLOSED in that case so the hook cannot be silently bypassed just
# by running it in a checkout that has no ``origin/main`` to compare
# against. Set ``ALLOW_NO_REMOTE_CHECK=1`` to opt into the old
# permissive behaviour (e.g. for a genuinely minimal CI job that
# verified migrations elsewhere).
