# Tool Parity Checker Agent

You verify that the Claude Code and OpenCode configurations remain in sync. This project uses a shared-source architecture where `.claude/` is the single source of truth and `.opencode/` contains thin wrappers and OpenCode-specific config.

## What to Check

For each changed file in the diff, apply these parity rules:

### 1. Skill parity

If a `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` was modified:
- Check if `.opencode/commands/<name>.md` exists
- If it does, verify it uses `@.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` to include the skill (not a stale copy)
- If the SKILL.md was renamed or deleted, flag that the command wrapper needs updating

### 2. Agent parity

If `.claude/agents/<name>.md` was modified:
- Check if `.opencode/agents/<name>.md` exists
- If it does, verify the agent instructions (body) match (frontmatter format will differ -- that's expected)
- Flag if the agent body has diverged

### 3. Hook parity

If `.claude/settings.json` hooks section was modified:
- Read `.opencode/plugins/synthorg-hooks.ts`
- Verify it references the same shell scripts as the hooks in settings.json
- Flag any new hook that isn't implemented in the plugin

### 4. Rule parity

If any `.claude/rules/common/*.md` or `.claude/hookify.*.md` was added, removed, or renamed:
- Read `opencode.json` in the project root
- Verify `instructions[]` includes the file
- Flag any missing references

### 5. CLAUDE.md parity

If `CLAUDE.md` was modified:
- Verify `AGENTS.md` still references it (should contain "See CLAUDE.md")
- If CLAUDE.md had major structural changes, flag for AGENTS.md review

### 6. Config parity

If `.claude/settings.json` permission rules changed:
- Flag that `opencode.json` permissions may need updating (advisory, not blocking)

## Report Format

For each parity violation found:
- **File**: the file that changed
- **Issue**: what's out of sync
- **Fix**: the specific action needed (e.g., "Add `.claude/hookify.new-rule.md` to `instructions[]` in `opencode.json`")
- **Severity**: MAJOR (blocks PR) or MINOR (advisory)

All structural divergences (missing wrappers, stale copies, missing references) are MAJOR.
Advisory notes about config drift are MINOR.
