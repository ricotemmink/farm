# Post-Merge Cleanup

Run this after squash-merging a PR to clean up the local repo.

## Steps

1. Switch to main and pull latest:
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   ```

2. Prune remote tracking branches that no longer exist on the remote:
   ```bash
   git fetch --prune
   ```

3. Delete local branches whose remote tracking branch is gone:

   First check which branches are gone using the plumbing command:

   ```bash
   git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(upstream:track,gone)' refs/heads | grep '\[gone\]$'
   ```

   If no gone branches exist, skip this step. Otherwise, delete each one individually:

   ```bash
   git branch -D <branch-name>
   ```

   If a gone branch has an associated worktree, remove the worktree first (`git worktree remove <path>`) before deleting the branch.

   Avoid piped bulk deletion (e.g., via `xargs`) to reduce the risk of accidental destructive operations. Use explicit `git branch -D branch1 branch2` calls instead.

4. Check for any remaining non-main local branches and report them. Do NOT delete branches that still have a remote -- only report them.

5. Confirm the workspace is clean with `git status`.
