    A new :class:`~synthorg.versioning.models.VersionSnapshot` is
    persisted only when the entity content has changed (determined by
    comparing SHA-256 content hashes).  Identical content produces a
    no-op, avoiding version inflation from spurious no-change saves.

    The version number is computed as ``latest.version + 1`` (or 1 if
    no versions exist).  The repository uses ``INSERT OR IGNORE``
    semantics, so concurrent saves of the same version number are safe:
    the second write is silently dropped.  This trade-off is acceptable
    because identity-like entities are updated at low frequency.
