"""Per-classification-run LLM cost budget tracker.

Simple async-safe in-memory tracker that accumulates cost across
semantic detector invocations within a single classification run.
Not persisted -- one instance per ``classify_execution_errors``
call.  All check-and-reserve operations are guarded by an
``asyncio.Lock`` so concurrent semantic detectors (e.g. siblings in
a ``CompositeDetector``) cannot race through the admission gate
and overspend the budget.
