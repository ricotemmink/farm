"""Default system prompt template and seniority-based autonomy instructions.

Provides the Jinja2 template used by
:func:`~synthorg.engine.prompt.build_system_prompt`
to render agent system prompts. The template uses conditional sections that are
omitted when the corresponding context is absent.

**Non-inferable principle (D22):** The default template omits the
``Available Tools`` section because tool definitions are already passed to
the LLM provider via the API's ``tools`` parameter.  Injecting them again
into the system prompt doubles cost with no benefit -- agents can discover
tool details from the API-level definitions.  Custom templates may still
reference ``{{ tools }}`` when explicitly needed.
