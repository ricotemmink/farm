"""Epistemic marker detection for compaction summaries.

Detects reasoning markers (hedging, reconsideration, uncertainty,
verification, correction) in assistant messages.  Messages with
high marker density are preserved during compaction to maintain
reasoning chain integrity.

Reference: arXiv:2603.24472 -- removing epistemic markers degrades
accuracy by up to 63% on complex reasoning tasks.
