"""Shadow task provider strategies.

Two strategies ship out of the box:

* ``ConfiguredShadowTaskProvider`` -- reads a curated task suite from
  ``ShadowEvaluationConfig.probe_tasks``.  This is the safe default:
  operators curate representative tasks per agent / role and the guard
  always evaluates against the same canonical suite.
* ``RecentTaskHistoryProvider`` -- samples up to N recent completed
  tasks for the agent via a pluggable ``TaskSampler`` callable.  This
  is opt-in: it trades curation effort for drift (the suite reflects
  whatever the agent has been doing lately).

Both providers return up to ``sample_size`` tasks.  An empty tuple is
a legitimate return and the guard rejects proposals when no probe
tasks are available.
