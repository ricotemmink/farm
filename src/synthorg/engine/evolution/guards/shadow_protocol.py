"""Protocols and models for shadow evaluation.

The shadow evaluation guard runs an adapted agent (the proposal applied
locally, not persisted) against a sample task suite and compares the
outcome to a baseline run of the current agent.  The guard composes
three pluggable pieces:

* ``ShadowTaskProvider`` -- sources the sample task suite.
* ``ShadowAgentRunner`` -- executes a single task against a given
  identity and (optionally) a pending proposal, returning a structured
  outcome.

The runner is owned by the caller because "how to run an agent" is
deployment-specific and because the guard must stay decoupled from the
full ``AgentEngine`` graph.  Production wiring adapts the runner to
``AgentEngine.run``; unit tests supply a deterministic fake.
