"""Distributed worker: pulls claims, executes tasks, transitions via HTTP.

The worker is a separate Python process launched via
``synthorg worker start`` (Go CLI wrapper at ``cli/cmd/worker_start.go``).
It connects to NATS JetStream for claim delivery and to the backend
HTTP API for task transitions, preserving the ``TaskEngine``
single-writer invariant: workers never write to persistence directly.

The execution path is intentionally minimal in this initial
implementation: the worker fetches a claim, calls an injected
``executor`` callable with the claim's ``task_id``, and surfaces the
outcome back to the backend. The executor is the seam where future
work plugs in the real agent runtime; today it is a callable the
caller provides (typically ``synthorg.engine.agent_engine`` in a
follow-up PR).
