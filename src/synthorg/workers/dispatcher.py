"""Distributed dispatcher: observes task state changes, enqueues claims.

Registered with :meth:`TaskEngine.register_observer` at engine startup
when ``config.queue.enabled`` is true. The dispatcher is a passive
observer: it never mutates task state directly. Instead it publishes
claim messages to the JetStream work queue, and workers pull from
there to execute tasks.

Single-writer invariant: the dispatcher does not write task state.
Workers call the backend HTTP API to transition tasks, which routes
through the normal ``TaskEngine`` mutation queue. The dispatcher only
reacts to successful mutations and publishes the enqueue signal.
