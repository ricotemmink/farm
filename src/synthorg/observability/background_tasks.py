"""Background task tracking for fire-and-forget coroutines.

Provides :class:`BackgroundTaskRegistry` -- a minimal utility that
spawns asyncio tasks, tracks them in a set, discards them on
completion, and logs failures via a done-callback. Use wherever a
subsystem must emit a best-effort notification in an exception path
and cannot ``await`` it because the primary exception must propagate
immediately (e.g. budget-exhaustion notifications that precede
``raise BudgetExhaustedError``).

Without this registry, tasks created via :func:`asyncio.create_task`
that raise silently vanish -- the coroutine's exception is only
surfaced as a garbage-collector warning, which CI and operators
never see. Reference: issue #1404.

    this helper is for callers who manage the task's lifecycle

    * Escalates ``MemoryError``/``RecursionError`` to CRITICAL + the
      event-loop exception handler (re-raising from a done-callback
      would be swallowed by asyncio).
