"""MCP catalog install helpers.

Pure functions that materialize ``McpInstallation`` rows into
``MCPServerConfig`` instances and merge them into the base
``MCPConfig`` loaded from YAML. Consumed by the MCP bridge factory
at startup so installed catalog entries become active servers
without touching the user-owned YAML config file.
