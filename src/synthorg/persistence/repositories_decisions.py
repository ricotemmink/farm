        TOCTOU race that a ``list_by_task`` + ``len(...) + 1`` pattern
        would create under concurrent reviewers.

            record_id: Unique record identifier (UUID recommended).

                always carry UTC timestamps.
            metadata: Forward-compatible metadata.  Defaults to ``{}``
                when not supplied -- callers that do not attach
                metadata do not have to pass an empty dict.
