"""Shared history and replay accessors for bus backends.

Each bus backend stores per-channel message history differently:
in-memory uses a bounded ``deque``, NATS JetStream uses a stream with
``MaxMsgsPerSubject``. This module exposes a thin ``HistoryAccessor``
protocol plus two implementations so each backend's
``get_channel_history`` is a one-liner that delegates to its accessor.

The split exists so the replay/history query path is unit-testable
independently of the driver (the deque accessor has no NATS
dependency; the JetStream accessor can be smoke-tested without a
full bus instance).
