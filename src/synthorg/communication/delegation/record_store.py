class DelegationRecordStore:
    """In-memory delegation record store with size-cap eviction and filtering.

    Provides both a sync ``record_sync`` method (for callers that
    cannot await) and async query methods.  When record count exceeds
    ``max_records``, oldest entries are evicted (FIFO) via bounded
    ``deque``.

    Concurrency note: ``record_sync`` does not acquire the async
    ``_lock`` (which serialises concurrent async readers only).
    Cooperative asyncio scheduling and deque's internal maxlen
    enforcement make single-call sync writes safe
    (``deque.append`` cannot be interrupted).  The eviction warning
    flag and the record buffer mutations are both held under
    ``_warning_lock`` (``threading.Lock``) so the check-then-set on
    ``_eviction_warned`` and the subsequent ``deque.append`` /
    ``deque.clear`` happen as a single atomic unit.  This prevents
    duplicate warnings caused by interleaving between checking the
    flag and updating it, and it keeps the flag in step with the
    buffer length -- ``clear()`` resets the flag for subsequent
    writes under the same lock.  Concurrent fill cycles may still
    observe each other's clears; the lock protects atomicity, not
    sequencing across independent cycles.
