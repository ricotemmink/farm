"""POSIX signal handlers for orderly shutdown.

This module installs explicit asyncio ``SIGTERM``/``SIGINT`` handlers
so we can log the signal the moment it arrives (before the ASGI
lifespan begins cancelling in-flight requests) and flag an
``AppState.shutdown_requested`` event that long-lived subsystems can
poll or ``await`` to exit early instead of waiting for cancellation.

Windows has no POSIX signals; the asyncio proactor event loop raises
``NotImplementedError`` on :meth:`add_signal_handler`. The helper logs
a DEBUG event and returns instead, so the app still boots.
