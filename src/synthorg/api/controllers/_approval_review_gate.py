"""Review-gate helpers for the approvals controller.

Extracted from ``approvals.py`` to keep that module under the 800-line
budget and to isolate the review-gate flow (mid-execution resume
vs review gate transition) from the controller CRUD logic.

Exposes:
- :func:`try_mid_execution_resume` -- resume parked context path.
- :func:`preflight_review_gate` -- pre-save self-review / task check.
- :func:`try_review_gate_transition` -- post-save IN_REVIEW transition.
- :func:`signal_resume_intent` -- orchestrates both flows.
