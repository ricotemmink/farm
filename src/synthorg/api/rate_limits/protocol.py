"""Sliding-window rate limiter Protocol (#1391).

The ``SlidingWindowStore`` Protocol is the pluggable contract that
per-operation guards call to acquire a slot.  The default implementation
lives in ``in_memory.py``; alternative adapters can be added behind the
factory without touching guard logic.

The Protocol is intentionally minimal -- one method, one dataclass-like
outcome -- so adapters can be added without touching guard logic.
