"""In-memory sliding-window rate limiter (#1391).

Each bucket holds a deque of monotonic timestamps.  On each ``acquire``
call, timestamps older than ``window_seconds`` are evicted; if the
remaining count is below ``max_requests``, the new timestamp is appended
and the request is allowed.  Otherwise the oldest remaining timestamp
gives the exact number of seconds the caller must wait.

The store is async-safe via a per-key ``asyncio.Lock``.  Buckets with
no activity for ``max(bucket_window * 2, 60)`` seconds are evicted by
a lightweight sweep on every N-th acquire to bound memory growth.  The
eviction horizon is computed per bucket from the last observed
``window_seconds`` so short-window operations cannot evict long-window
buckets prematurely.
