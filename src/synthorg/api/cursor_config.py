"""Pagination cursor configuration.

Carries the HMAC signing key used by :mod:`synthorg.api.cursor`. The key
is loaded from the ``api.pagination.cursor_secret`` setting (masked in
logs) with fallback to ``SYNTHORG_PAGINATION_CURSOR_SECRET`` for
containerised deployments that prefer secret injection via env vars.

When no key is configured, the cursor module generates an ephemeral
per-process key and logs a WARNING once at boot. Ephemeral keys make
pagination tokens invalid across restarts -- operators must set the
key in any deployment that expects stable cursors.
