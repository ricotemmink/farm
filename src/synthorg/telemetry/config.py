The collector resolves the effective environment from four inputs,
in order:

1. ``SYNTHORG_TELEMETRY_ENV`` -- explicit operator override, always wins.
2. Well-known CI markers (``CI``, ``GITLAB_CI``, ``BUILDKITE``,
   ``JENKINS_URL``, or any ``RUNPOD_*``) -- tags as ``ci``.
3. ``SYNTHORG_TELEMETRY_ENV_BAKED`` -- baked into the image at build
   time via ``docker/backend/Dockerfile``'s ``DEPLOYMENT_ENV`` build
   argument. Release-tag builds ship ``prod``; ``-dev.N`` pre-release
   tag builds ship ``pre-release``; everything else (main pushes,
   PR builds, local ``docker build``) ships the Dockerfile default
   ``dev``.
4. This constant -- the last-resort fallback when nothing else matched.

A non-blank default avoids ``null`` showing up as
``deployment.environment`` in Logfire, which used to make every
deployment look identical in the span stream.

    """Configuration for opt-in anonymous project telemetry.

    Telemetry is **disabled by default**. When enabled, only
    aggregate usage metrics are sent -- never API keys, chat
    content, or personal data. Telemetry is SynthOrg-owned and
    project-scoped: the write token is embedded in source and
    cannot be redirected to a different backend. Operators that
    need their own observability stack use the Postgres +
    Prometheus + audit-chain path, not this module.

    Attributes:
        enabled: Master switch (default ``False``). Can be
            overridden by the ``SYNTHORG_TELEMETRY`` env var.
        backend: Reporter backend to use.
        heartbeat_interval_hours: Hours between periodic heartbeat
            events.
        environment: Deployment environment tag (``local-docker``,
            ``ci``, ``prod``, ...). Rendered as OTel
            ``deployment.environment`` on the Logfire resource and
            attached to every event. Overridden at runtime by the
            ``SYNTHORG_TELEMETRY_ENV`` env var. Defaults to
            :data:`DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT` so events are always tagged
            even when the operator has not set one.
