        deployment_id: Anonymous UUID identifying the deployment.

        os_platform: Operating system platform identifier.

            ``deployment.environment`` resource attribute so every
            span in Logfire can be filtered without joining on a
            startup event.
        timestamp: UTC timestamp of the event.
        properties: Event-specific key-value data.  Values are
            restricted to primitives (int, float, str, bool).
