## What is SynthOrg?

SynthOrg lets you define agents with roles, personalities, budgets, and tools, then orchestrate them to collaborate on complex tasks as a virtual organization. Each agent has a defined role (CEO, developer, designer, QA), persistent memory, and access to real tools. Agents collaborate through structured communication, follow workflows, and produce real artifacts — code, documents, designs, and more.

The framework is provider-agnostic (any LLM via LiteLLM), configuration-driven (YAML + Pydantic), and designed for the full autonomy spectrum — from locked-down human approval of every action to fully autonomous operation.

## Capabilities

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%">

**Agent Orchestration**

Define agents with roles, models, and tools. The engine handles task decomposition, routing, execution loops (ReAct, Plan-and-Execute), and multi-agent coordination.

</td>
<td width="33%">

**Budget & Cost Management**

Per-agent cost limits, auto-downgrade to cheaper models at task boundaries, spending reports, CFO-level cost optimization with anomaly detection.

</td>
<td width="33%">

**Security & Trust**

SecOps agent with fail-closed rule engine, progressive trust (4 strategies), configurable autonomy levels, audit logging, and approval timeout policies.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Memory**

Per-agent and shared organizational memory with retrieval pipeline, non-inferable filtering, consolidation, and archival. Pluggable backends via protocol.

</td>
<td>

**Communication**

Message bus, hierarchical delegation with loop prevention, conflict resolution (4 strategies), and meeting protocols (round-robin, position papers, structured phases).

</td>
<td>

**Tools & Integration**

Built-in tools (file system, git, sandbox, code runner) plus MCP bridge for external tools. Layered sandboxing with subprocess and Docker backends.

## Quick Start

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aureliolo/synthorg.git
cd synthorg
uv sync                  # install dev + test deps
uv sync --group docs     # install docs toolchain (mkdocs)
```

### Docker Compose

```bash
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
docker compose -f docker/compose.yml up -d
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health   # verify
docker compose -f docker/compose.yml down  # stop
```

## Status

Core framework complete — agent engine, multi-agent coordination, API, security, HR, memory, and budget systems are implemented. Remaining: Mem0 adapter backend, approval workflow gates, CLI, web dashboard. See the [roadmap](docs/roadmap/index.md) for details.
