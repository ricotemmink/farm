SynthOrg is a Python framework for building **synthetic organizations** -- autonomous AI agents orchestrated as a virtual company. Unlike task-queue or DAG-based agent frameworks, SynthOrg models agents as members of an actual organization with roles, departments, hierarchies, persistent memory, budgets, and structured communication.

Define your company in YAML. Agents collaborate through a message bus, follow workflows (Kanban, Agile sprints, or custom), track costs against budgets, and produce real artifacts. The framework is provider-agnostic (100+ LLMs via [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)), configuration-driven ([Pydantic v2](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) models), and designed for the full autonomy spectrum -- from human approval on every action to fully autonomous operation.

> **Early access.** Core subsystems are built and tested (13,000+ unit tests, 80%+ coverage). APIs may change between releases. See the [roadmap](https://synthorg.io/docs/roadmap/) for what's next.

## Why SynthOrg?

Most agent frameworks give you **functions that call LLMs**. SynthOrg gives you a **company that thinks**.

- **Roles, not functions.** Agents are CEO, engineer, designer, QA -- with personality, goals, seniority, and autonomy levels. 9 company templates and 23 personality presets get you started fast.
- **Shared organizational memory.** Hybrid retrieval pipeline (dense + BM25 sparse with RRF fusion), tool-based and context injection strategies, procedural memory auto-generation from failures, consolidation, and archival. Agents remember across sessions.
- **Cost-aware by design.** Per-agent token budgets, automatic model downgrade at task boundaries, spending reports, trend analysis, and CFO-level optimization with anomaly detection.
- **Trust spectrum.** From locked-down (human approves every tool call) to fully autonomous -- with a fail-closed security rule engine, output scanning, progressive trust, and audit logging in between.
- **Real workflows.** Kanban boards, Agile sprints with velocity tracking, ceremony scheduling (8 strategies), visual workflow editor with starter blueprints and version history with diff/rollback, and workflow execution from graph definitions.
- **Provider-agnostic.** Any LLM via LiteLLM -- Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, and 100+ cloud providers. Local model management with pull/delete/configure for Ollama and LM Studio.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
# Linux / macOS
curl -sSfL https://synthorg.io/get/install.sh | bash
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://synthorg.io/get/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Run

```bash
synthorg init                                   # interactive setup wizard (SQLite default)
synthorg init --persistence-backend postgres    # auto-provision a Postgres container
synthorg start                                  # pull images + start containers
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) -- the **setup wizard** walks you through company config, LLM providers, agent setup with personality presets, and theme selection. Choose **Guided Setup** for the full experience or **Quick Setup** (company name + provider only, configure the rest later).

**Persistence backends:** SQLite (default) for single-node and development, Postgres for multi-instance and production deployments. The CLI orchestrates both -- `--persistence-backend postgres` generates a `postgres:18-alpine` service, random credentials, and a named data volume. `synthorg stop` preserves the data volume unless `--volumes` is passed.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aureliolo/synthorg.git
cd synthorg
uv sync                  # install dev + test deps
uv sync --group docs     # install docs toolchain
```

Schema migrations require the [Atlas CLI](https://atlasgo.io/getting-started) on `PATH`. Building the docs site locally (for D2 diagrams) additionally requires the [D2 CLI](https://d2lang.com/tour/install) on `PATH`.

### Docker Compose (manual)

```bash
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
docker compose -f docker/compose.yml up -d
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health
```

## What's Inside

**[Agent Orchestration](https://synthorg.io/docs/design/engine/)** -- Task decomposition, 6 routing strategies, execution loops (ReAct, Plan-and-Execute, Hybrid, auto-selection by complexity), crash recovery with checkpoint resume, multi-agent coordination, and multi-project support with project-scoped teams and isolated budgets.

**[Agent Evolution](https://synthorg.io/docs/design/agents/)** -- Continuous identity evolution based on performance trends with pluggable triggers (batched, inflection, per-task), proposers (separate-analyzer, self-report, composite), and guards (rollback, review, shadow evaluation).

**[Dynamic Workforce Scaling](https://synthorg.io/docs/design/agents/#dynamic-scaling)** -- Closed-loop hiring and pruning with pluggable strategies (workload, budget cap, skill gap, performance), safety guards (conflict resolution, cooldowns, rate limits, approval gates), and a dashboard for manual evaluation triggers.

**[Budget & Cost Management](https://synthorg.io/docs/design/operations/)** -- Per-agent and per-project cost limits with hierarchical cascading, auto-downgrade to cheaper models at task boundaries, spending reports, budget forecasting, and anomaly detection.

**[Security & Trust](https://synthorg.io/docs/security/)** -- SecOps agent with fail-closed rule engine, progressive trust (4 strategies), configurable autonomy levels (4 tiers), approval gates, LLM fallback evaluator, and audit logging. Container images are cosign-signed with [SLSA L3](https://slsa.dev) provenance.

**[Memory](https://synthorg.io/docs/design/memory/)** -- 5 memory types (episodic, semantic, procedural, working, organizational) with hybrid retrieval, three injection strategies (context, tool-based, and self-editing memory), query reformulation, procedural memory auto-generation from failures, consolidation, and pluggable backends.

**[Communication](https://synthorg.io/docs/design/communication/)** -- Message bus, hierarchical delegation with loop prevention, conflict resolution (4 strategies), meeting protocols (round-robin, position papers, structured phases), and A2A federation with external agent systems.
