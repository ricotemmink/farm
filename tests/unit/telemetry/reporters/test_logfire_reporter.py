"""Regression tests for ``LogfireReporter``.

The collector's ``_send`` helper only flips the "delivered" return
value to ``False`` when ``report()`` raises. Earlier revisions of
the Logfire reporter logged and swallowed backend exceptions, so
failed writes surfaced as successful deliveries (``*_SENT``
debug events fired regardless). These tests lock in the
propagate-don't-swallow contract so that regression cannot sneak
back in. The reporter does **not** log ``TELEMETRY_REPORT_FAILED``
itself -- :meth:`TelemetryCollector._send` owns that alert and
duplicate logs would double-count failures.
