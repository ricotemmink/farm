# Agent Management

SynthOrg treats agents as real employees: they get hired, promoted, and fired through operator workflows. This guide covers the current lifecycle surface (hire, update, fire via the REST API) plus the planned archival and rehire paths and the manual workarounds that apply until they ship.

For the architecture (identity versioning, evolution, five-pillar evaluation), see [Agents](../design/agents.md) and [HR & Agent Lifecycle](../design/hr-lifecycle.md).

## Hiring

Agents are hired via `POST /api/v1/agents` with a `CreateAgentOrgRequest` body. The DTO accepts only: `name`, `role`, `department`, `level` (one of the `SeniorityLevel` values), and the `model_provider` / `model_id` pair (both together or both omitted -- if omitted, the model matcher falls back to the provider catalog default).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/agents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: ${SESSION}" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Sarah Chen",
    "role": "Senior Backend Developer",
    "department": "Engineering",
    "level": "Senior",
    "model_provider": "example-provider",
    "model_id": "example-medium-001"
  }' | jq
```

Personality presets and personality dimensions are **not** fields on the hiring DTO. They are applied during the first-run setup flow via `SetupAgentRequest` (see [Setup wizard shortcuts](#setup-wizard-shortcuts) below). `PersonalityConfig` internals (`decision_making`, `collaboration`, `verbosity`, `conflict_approach`, and the Big-5 dimensions) are runtime state, not user-settable through the public API.

```bash
# List available presets (used by the setup wizard, not by POST /api/v1/agents)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/personalities/presets \
  -H "Cookie: ${SESSION}" | jq '.data[] | {name, description}'
```

Tool access and autonomy are **not** part of `CreateAgentOrgRequest` either: tool grants are resolved from role, department, and org config at runtime, and `autonomy_level` is set on `UpdateAgentOrgRequest` (or on the department-level endpoints) *after* the agent is hired. See [Updating an agent](#updating-an-agent).

## Updating an agent

Partial updates via `PATCH /api/v1/agents/{name}`. The server validates conflicts and domain constraints (e.g. duplicate names, missing departments); consult the OpenAPI schema for the exact accepted fields and response codes.

```bash
# Change autonomy
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3001/api/v1/agents/${AGENT_NAME} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: ${SESSION}" \
  -d '{"autonomy_level": "supervised"}'

# Swap model pair (both fields must be set together)
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3001/api/v1/agents/${AGENT_NAME} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: ${SESSION}" \
  -d '{"model_provider": "example-provider", "model_id": "example-large-001"}'
```

`UpdateAgentOrgRequest` accepts only: `name`, `role`, `department`, `level`, `autonomy_level`, `model_provider`, `model_id`.

Every update creates a new `AgentIdentity` version snapshot in `agent_identity_versions`. Query the history:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/agents/${AGENT_ID}/versions \
  -H "Cookie: ${SESSION}" | jq '.data[] | {version, content_hash, saved_by, saved_at}'

# Diff two versions
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/v1/agents/${AGENT_ID}/versions/diff?from_version=1&to_version=3" \
  -H "Cookie: ${SESSION}" | jq '.data.field_changes[] | {field_path, change_type, old_value, new_value}'

# Rollback
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/agents/${AGENT_ID}/versions/rollback \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: ${SESSION}" \
  -d '{"target_version": 1, "reason": "v2 overshot on autonomy"}' | jq
```

## Firing

Firing is a CRITICAL-risk operation requiring human approval by default. The pruning service can also propose fires based on performance trends.

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/v1/agents/${AGENT_NAME} \
  -H "Cookie: ${SESSION}"
```

The `DELETE /api/v1/agents/{agent_name}` endpoint does not accept a request body. Approval metadata (reason, justification) is recorded separately when the `CRITICAL`-risk approval gate captures the decision.

Current behavior (`delete_agent` in `src/synthorg/api/services/_org_agent_mutations.py`):

1. The API validates the agent exists and runs org-mutation guard checks.
2. The agent record is removed from the active org configuration.
3. A company snapshot is persisted and an `API_AGENT_DELETED` event is logged and broadcast on the `agents` WebSocket channel.

Planned (not yet implemented): automated task reassignment via `TaskReassignmentStrategy`, memory archival via `MemoryArchivalStrategy`, selective promotion to `OrgMemoryBackend`, and an explicit `TERMINATED` lifecycle state. Until those land, fires are best paired with manual task reassignment before the DELETE call.

## Rehiring from archive (planned)

A dedicated `POST /api/v1/agents/{agent_name}/rehire` endpoint -- which would restore archived memory into a new identity with a fresh hire date and version chain -- is **not yet implemented** in the agents controller. Until it ships, rehiring is a manual two-step: list archived agents via the existing listing, then recreate with `POST /api/v1/agents` using a fresh `CreateAgentOrgRequest` payload; memory restoration is performed out-of-band through the Memory Admin API. This planned surface sits alongside the same lifecycle automation called out in [Firing](#firing).

## Lifecycle events (WebSocket)

Subscribe to the `agents` channel to get real-time lifecycle events:

```javascript
ws.send(JSON.stringify({ action: 'subscribe', channels: ['agents'] }))
// Actually emitted on the `agents` channel today (see
// src/synthorg/api/controllers/agents.py and app_helpers.py):
//   agent.created, agent.updated, agent.deleted, personality.trimmed
```

See [Notifications & Events](notifications-and-events.md) for the full protocol.

## Setup wizard shortcuts

`/api/v1/setup/*` is the first-run wizard. Template-based auto-creation happens at `POST /api/v1/setup/company` when a template is selected; the wizard hydrates the org with the template's default agents in one shot. For the "Start Blank" path, `POST /api/v1/setup/agent` creates a single agent with an explicit model assignment:

```bash
# Create one agent on the Start Blank path; model assignment is required.
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/setup/agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: ${SESSION}" \
  -d '{
    "role": "Senior Backend Developer",
    "name": "Sarah Chen",
    "model_provider": "example-provider",
    "model_id": "example-medium-001"
  }'
```

After the wizard completes, use `/api/v1/agents` for subsequent changes.
