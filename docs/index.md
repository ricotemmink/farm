# SynthOrg Documentation

**Framework for building synthetic organizations** — autonomous AI agents orchestrated as a virtual company.

SynthOrg lets you define agents with roles, hierarchy, budgets, and tools, then orchestrate them to collaborate on complex tasks as a virtual organization.

!!! warning "Under Active Development"

    SynthOrg is under active development. Many features described in the design specification
    are planned but not yet implemented. See the [Roadmap](roadmap/index.md) for current status.

## Key Features

- **Agent Orchestration** — Define agents with roles, models, and tools. The engine handles task decomposition, routing, and collaboration.
- **Budget Enforcement** — Per-agent cost limits, auto-downgrade to cheaper models, spending reports, and CFO-level cost optimization.
- **Security & Trust** — SecOps agent, fail-closed rule engine, progressive trust (4 strategies), autonomy levels, and audit logging.
- **Memory** — Per-agent and shared organizational memory with retrieval pipeline, consolidation, and archival.
- **Communication** — Message bus, delegation, conflict resolution (4 strategies), and meeting protocols.
- **HR Engine** — Hiring, firing, onboarding, offboarding, performance tracking, and promotion criteria.
- **Tool Integration** — Built-in tools (file system, git, sandbox, code runner) plus MCP bridge for external tools.
- **LLM Providers** — Provider-agnostic via LiteLLM. Routing strategies, retry/rate-limiting, capability matching.
