# SynthOrg - High-Level Design Specification

> A framework for building synthetic organizations -- autonomous AI agents orchestrated as a virtual company, with configurable roles, hierarchies, communication patterns, and tool access.

---

The design specification has been split into focused documentation pages for better navigation and maintainability. Each page covers a cohesive domain of the framework's design.
