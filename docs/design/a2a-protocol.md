# A2A Protocol

The [A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol](https://agent-protocol.ai) is a standard for heterogeneous agent communication. SynthOrg exposes an A2A gateway that lets external agent systems discover, invoke, and receive updates from the internal roster -- without either side needing to understand the other's internal shape.

This page is the status-and-architecture reference: what ships today, how it maps onto SynthOrg's internal model, and what's next.

## Status

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| A2A gateway (`src/synthorg/a2a/gateway.py`) | Shipped |
| Agent Card serving (`GET /.well-known/agent-card.json`) | Shipped |
| JSON-RPC task submission + SSE streaming | Shipped |
| Agent Card projection from internal `AgentIdentity` | Shipped |
| Push notification subscription + webhook delivery | Shipped |
| Auth schemes: `apiKey`, `oauth2`, `bearer`, `mTLS`, `none` | Shipped |
| Allowlist-based inbound authorization | Shipped |
| Optional JWS Agent Card signature verification | Shipped |
| Webhook HMAC signature verification + replay protection | Shipped |
| SSRF validation on outbound webhooks | Shipped |
| Delegation guard on inbound requests (loop prevention) | Shipped |
| Quadratic communication enforcement strategies | Planned (detection ships today; enforcement is opt-in behind `alert_only`) |
| Full A2A skill negotiation workflow | Planned |
| Inter-org federation patterns (delegation across organizations) | Planned |

A2A is **disabled by default**. Enable via `a2a.enabled: true` in company YAML and configure auth + allowlist per deployment.

## Architecture

```d2
direction: right

ExtAgent: External agent

SynthOrg: {
  Gateway: A2A Gateway
  DelegGuard: DelegationGuard
  InternalBus: Internal MessageBus
  Hub: EventStreamHub
  Projection: A2A Projection
  WebhookRX: WebhookReceiver

  Gateway -> DelegGuard: "auth + allowlist + signature"
  DelegGuard -> InternalBus
  Hub -> Projection
  WebhookRX -> InternalBus: "HMAC verify + replay dedup"
}

ExtAgent -> SynthOrg.Gateway: "JSON-RPC / SSE"
SynthOrg.Projection -> ExtAgent: "SSE or webhook"
ExtAgent -> SynthOrg.WebhookRX: "Push notification"
```

The gateway is a thin translation layer: inbound A2A requests become internal `MessageBus` messages after passing the delegation guard and A2A-specific security checks. Outbound state is served through a per-consumer projection over the shared `EventStreamHub` -- no duplicate event source.

See [Security & Approval -> A2A Security](security.md#a2a-security) for the full auth, trust, webhook, and SSRF enforcement reference.

## Agent Card Projection

SynthOrg projects its internal `AgentIdentity` model to the A2A Agent Card format at `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json`. Every structured skill on an agent (`SkillSet.primary` + `SkillSet.secondary`) maps to an A2A `AgentSkill`:

| SynthOrg field | A2A AgentSkill | Purpose |
|----------------|----------------|---------|
| `Skill.id` | `id` | Unique skill identifier |
| `Skill.name` | `name` | Human-readable display name |
| `Skill.description` | `description` | Capability description for semantic matching |
| `Skill.tags` | `tags` | Searchable tags for multi-faceted routing |
| `Skill.input_modes` | `inputModes` | MIME types accepted |
| `Skill.output_modes` | `outputModes` | MIME types produced |
| `Skill.proficiency` | -- | SynthOrg-specific; not projected (no A2A field yet) |

See [Agents -> Skill Model](agents.md#skill-model) for the skill structure.

## Loop Prevention

External agents are treated as delegation sources. The same five `DelegationGuard` mechanisms that protect internal delegation chains also apply to A2A inbound requests:

1. **Depth cap** -- max delegation chain length
2. **Ancestry check** -- reject cycles in the delegation graph
3. **Per-pair rate limit** -- throttle repeated delegations between the same agents
4. **Structural circuit breaker** -- detect rapid oscillation
5. **Budget guard** -- reject when the delegation chain has consumed too much

See [Communication -> Loop Prevention](communication.md#loop-prevention) for implementation.

## Quadratic Communication Detection

`MessageOverhead.is_quadratic` flags configurations where pairwise agent-to-agent messaging approaches `O(n^2)`. External agent federation can amplify this (every external connection potentially talks to every internal agent).

Four enforcement strategies are defined behind `QuadraticEnforcementStrategy`:

| Strategy | Behavior |
|----------|-----------|
| `alert_only` (default) | Detect and emit `NotificationDispatcher` warnings |
| `soft_throttle` | Auto-tighten rate limiter on the affected agent group |
| `hard_block` | Reject new connections when `max_agent_connections` exceeded |
| `disabled` | No detection or enforcement |

Only `alert_only` ships today; the other three are defined in config but not yet implemented. See [Security -> Quadratic Communication Enforcement](security.md#quadratic-communication-enforcement).

## Configuration Summary

The full A2A config is documented in [Security -> A2AConfig](security.md#a2aconfig). The minimum viable production setup:

```yaml
a2a:
  enabled: true
  auth:
    inbound: apiKey
    outbound: bearer
    api_key: "${A2A_API_KEY}"
    outbound_token: "${A2A_OUTBOUND_TOKEN}"
  allowed_agents:
    - "https://partner.example.com/.well-known/agent-card.json"
  max_request_body_bytes: 1048576
```

`none` inbound auth is rejected for production deployments. Agent Card signature verification (`agent_card_verification.require_signatures: true`) is recommended when peers are untrusted.
