# Documentation Consistency Agent

You check that documentation accurately reflects the current state of the codebase. This agent runs on **every PR** regardless of change type.

Read the current `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` in full, plus the relevant `docs/design/` pages (see `docs/DESIGN_SPEC.md` for the index). Then compare against the PR diff and the actual current state of the codebase. Flag anything that is now inaccurate, incomplete, or missing.

**Key principle:** It is better to flag a false positive than to let documentation drift silently. When in doubt, flag it.

## What to Check

### Design pages in `docs/design/` (CRITICAL -- project source of truth)

1. `design/agents.md` "Project Structure" -- does it match actual files/directories under `src/synthorg/`? Any new modules missing? Any listed files that no longer exist? (CRITICAL)
2. `design/agents.md` "Agent Identity Card" -- does the config/runtime split documentation match the actual model code? (MAJOR)
3. `design/agents.md` "Key Design Decisions" -- are technology choices and rationale still accurate? (MAJOR)
4. `design/agents.md` "Pydantic Model Conventions" -- do documented conventions match how models are actually written? Are "Adopted" vs "Planned" labels still accurate? (MAJOR)
5. `design/operations.md` "Cost Tracking" -- does the implementation note match actual `TokenUsage` and spending summary models? (MAJOR)
6. `design/engine.md` "Tool Execution Model" -- does it match actual `ToolInvoker` behavior? (MAJOR)
7. `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` "Technology Stack" -- are versions, libraries, and rationale current? (MEDIUM)
8. `design/operations.md` "Provider Configuration" -- are model IDs, provider capability examples, and config/runtime mapping still representative? (MEDIUM)
9. `design/operations.md` "LiteLLM Integration" -- does the integration status match reality? (MEDIUM)
10. Any other section that describes behavior, structure, or patterns that have changed (MAJOR)

### CLAUDE.md (CRITICAL -- guides all future development)

11. Code Conventions -- do documented patterns match what's actually in the code? New patterns used but not documented? Documented patterns no longer followed? (CRITICAL)
12. Logging section -- are event import paths, logger patterns, and rules accurate? (CRITICAL)
13. Resilience section -- does it match actual retry/rate-limit implementation? (MAJOR)
14. Package Structure -- does it match actual directory layout? (MAJOR)
15. Testing section -- are markers, commands, and conventions current? (MEDIUM)
16. Any other section that gives instructions that don't match reality (CRITICAL)

### README.md

17. Installation, usage, and getting-started instructions -- still accurate? (MAJOR)
18. Feature descriptions -- do they match what's actually built? (MEDIUM)
19. Links -- any dead links or references to things that moved? (MINOR)

## Severity Levels

- **CRITICAL**: Documentation actively misleading about project conventions or architecture
- **MAJOR**: Documentation incomplete, stale, or describes removed features
- **MEDIUM**: Minor inaccuracies, outdated versions, formatting
- **MINOR**: Wording improvements, dead links

## Report Format

For each finding:
```
[SEVERITY] doc_file:section <-> code_file:line
  Drift: What the documentation says
  Reality: What the code actually does
  Fix: Which to update (doc or code, based on context)
```
